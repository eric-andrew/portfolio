			<h4>1. The Problem</h4>
			<p>The biggest challenge here is that we need an e-commerce platform that would stop the client from going through with their purchase until they have chosen an event date that is open. There isn't a turnkey solution that handles that business need and comes in under budget. I designed a simple and elegant solution for this problem but, we had to work within Squarespace's constraints.</p>

			<h4>2. Takeaways</h4>
			<p>I completed development and am happy with the outcome and am really glad that we were able to feature the amazing product photography she had done.</p>
