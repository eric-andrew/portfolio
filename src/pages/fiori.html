		<h4>1. The Problem</h4>
		<p>When designing for the enterprise, especially at SAP where the user base is almost a billion people, there are countless personas, problems and tasks designers need to solve for. Here, we needed to organize a lot of information in a useful way for designers from around the globe can build the applications they need with the most recent, up-to-date, knowledge from the central Fiori team.</p>

		<h4>2. My Role </h4>
		<p>I was on this project as a designer and developer. As a part of a team of three, I was involved in ideation, visual and UX design, and implementation. </p>

		<h4>3. The Solution</h4>
		<p> The design decisions on this site were handled by a team of three of us and the bulk of the work I did was in the navigation and search. I needed to come up with a way to present the breadth of information in a discoverable, searchable way. Communicating a hierarchy of information was difficult here. We were also constrained by the wordpress plugins we were using and the volume of content.</p>

		<h4>4. Takeaways</h4>
		<p>This was my first project working with a team overseas. I worked with a development partner based in Germany and ended up traveling over there to complete the project. There were also a lot of tight deadlines and high level pressure. In the end, I enjoyed working with a team and came to value being in the same room as everyone on the project.</p>
