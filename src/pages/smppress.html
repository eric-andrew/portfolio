		<h4>The Problem</h4>
		<p>We needed to drive sign ups and submissions on the site. Our users are pretty small subset of the population i.e. musicians that read, write and create sheet music. In order to increase conversions and get users to submit their work, we had to provide a well rounded experience on all fronts.</p>

		<h4 class="mb-2">Takeaways</h4>
		<p>All in all, I really enjoyed working with SMP because the team and leadership are excellent. The hardest part was working alone and without a major research budget. I could have done a few things better including sticking to the processes more closely and documenting more along the way to leave behind.</p>

				<li>2. The user comes looking for a song to work on.</li>

			<p>To find the title matching their arrangement, if it's in the program, they'd need to search the database from here, identify their title, copy the copyright information and go straight to the form to upload their work.</p>

			<p>The legal concerns musicians have with selling their version of copyrighted music are very much warranted. At every turn we wanted to assure our users that they're well within their rights to do so as SMP had secured the legal means to make it happen. A welcome dialog is necessary to show them around the first time they log in.</p>

			<p>Based on our research and analytics, the first thing our users want to see when they log in to see is their sales reports. In dashboard, at a glance scenario, we wanted to give that information top priority while giving the user other vital information along with it. Here, we achieved that objective with their most recent uploads and help questions linked to right from the first page they see when they logged in.</p>

			<h5>4. Takeaways</h5>
			<p>All in all, I really enjoyed working with SMP because the team and leadership are excellent. I was given a lot of creative freedom. The users are thankful for the updates and also given us very positive feedback. SMP Pressers have been accustomed to the design of the product as it was and there is a loud contingent on a facebook group that gives us feedback.</p>
