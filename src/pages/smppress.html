		<h4>The Problem</h4>
		<p>We needed to drive sign ups and submissions on the site. Our users are pretty small subset of the population i.e. musicians that read, write and create sheet music. In order to increase conversions and get users to submit their work, we had to provide a well rounded experience on all fronts.</p>
