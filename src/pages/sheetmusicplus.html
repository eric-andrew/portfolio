		<h4>1. SheetMusicPlus.com</h4>
		<p>I was tasked with identifying quick wins / easy fixes / low hanging fruit that would increase ease of use with next to no development investment. Below are the details notes I passed off to the development team.</p>

		<h4>2. Marketing Collateral</h4>
		<p>Due to an unforeseen circumstance during my tenure at Sheet Music Plus, I was asked to fill in doing marketing graphics for email campaigns, website sales and coupons, affiliate marketing collareral, as well as print ads and mailers. Being the team player I am, I accepted the challenge. For six months I made graphics for affiliate and email marketing, in addition to sale and category banners for the main site. </p>

		<h4>3. Conclusion</h4>
		<p>I learned about more about the metrics, planning, and strategies of marketing than I ever thought I would and was able to hone my Photoshop skills in new ways. I would've never expected to do this kind of work but, the team at SMP was a joy to work with and the experience was extremeley valuable.</p>
		<p>My favorite part about doing this work was that it rewarded my willingness and openness to learn and grow in all directions.</p>
