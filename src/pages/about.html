			<p>I'm a multi-disclipinary designer and former developer. I'm always interested in taking on new challenges. I am mostly interested in products that serve a utility or business function. i.e. HR / HCM, fintech, ecommerce or logistics. </p>

			<p><b>Critical thinking.</b> I was a philosophy major. The skills I learned in school will pay a variety of dividends for the rest of my life. Holistic, analytical decision-making, removed from emotion, is an area where I excel. The <a href="https://altmba.com/">AltMBA</a> program I did last summer was a great refresher course, too. </p>
			<p><b>Communication.</b> I'm constantly evaluating how I show up and hold space for people, how I interact with colleagues, and how I give feedback to myself and others. I can take criticism because I've done, and continue to do the work. "Talk less and ask more. Your advice is not as good as you think it is" - <a href="https://boxofcrayons.com/the-coaching-habit-book/">The Coaching Habit</a></p>

			<div class="separator border-gray-900"></div>
			<p><b>Work - Life balance.</b> I strive to maintain a healthy relationship to work and pursue passion projects outside of work to keep my mind fresh and sharp.</p>
			<p><b>Life Long learner.</b> I believe anyone can be a teacher. I look for opportunities to grow and gain insight from people, no matter their station in life. I'm firmly in the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth mindset</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Service.</b> Coming from a military family, I feel perpetually called to serve a common humanity, to give back to a greater good through great design and genuine interactions.</p>
