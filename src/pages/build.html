		<h4>Problem</h4>
		<p>The ecosystem as SAP is robust and the amount of customization that customers need for their apps would be impossible to handle even for a company as large as this one. There are thousands of applications built for dozens of business needs serviced by one design language. </p>

		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>The build project aimed to put that customization in the hands of people at every step of the business process by providing them with a prototyping tool that gave them production level code.</p>

		<h4>Takeaways</h4>
		<p>I learned so much from this project. It was enormous and had five teams working in four different countries. In addition to working on an agile development team, I was involved in a lot of design thinking, research and UX work as well as a good deal of Project and Product Management.</p>
