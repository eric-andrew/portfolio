years: 2020
description: In January of this year, I took on the task of learning as much as possible about a brand new industry while relying on my design instincts and experience to make a meaningful impact where I could. Ultimately, my short time at Anomali gave me some great people to work with and challenging work to show here. I was laid at the end of April off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
