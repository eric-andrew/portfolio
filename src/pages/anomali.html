		<h4>2. My Role </h4>
		<p>I was on this project as a front-end developer for the last 18 months of my tenure. I worked primarily on the prototyping tool but, was involved in a rebrand and rebuild of the marketing site.</p>
		<h4>3. The Solution</h4>
		<p>The build project aimed to put that customization in the hands of people at every step of the business process by providing them with a prototyping tool that gave them production level code.</p>

		<h4>4. Takeaways</h4>
		<p>I learned so much from this project. It was enormous and had five teams working in four different countries. In addition to working on an agile development team, I was involved in a lot of design thinking, research and UX work as well as a good deal of Project and Product Management.</p>
